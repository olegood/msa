# Microservices Fundamentals

## Description

This program is aimed to:

- Show of microservices architecture, learn tools, technologies and patterns that are more commonly used in
  microservices architecture such as _API Gateway_, _Service Discovery_, _Circuit Breaker_;
- Develop understanding of applicability and use cases for microservices architecture;
- Verify learned material with practical tasks and exercises;
- Teach practices and approaches that could be used in production projects
